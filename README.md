Arch Titus with my own tweaks

bash <(curl -L https://tinyurl.com/silvchef)

Note: the script uses git in addition to curl. it will attempt to install it, but if the install fails, manual intervention will be required. 

Also be aware that the dotfiles provided for hyprland by this script are currently a work in progress; it will set up a working system, but it's not good enough in my opinion quite yet.
